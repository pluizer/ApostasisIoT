* Apostasis and IoT

** Preparing the device

   To get started with connecting to the @postasis platform we must first prepare the device. This manual assumes you are using the ESP8266 compatible device. Other Internet-enabled Arduino’s or Arduino clones can be used but one must look up the documentation on how to get started oneself. A ESP8266 is recommended to keep the project and examples uniform and can be ordered quite cheaply. It has built-in Wi-Fi capabilities.

   The first step is to add NodeMCU support to de Arduino IDE which this manual assumes is already installed on your pc.
   
   * Open the Arduino IDE, click on File → Preferences and paste the url: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into the Additional Boards Manager Urls.

   * Close the window. Click Tools → Board → Board Manager and search for esp8266 and install it.

   At this point the Arduino IDE is able to upload code to boards with an ESP8266 chip. To enable it navigate to Tools → Boards and select the board you are using. Now we are ready to upload the ApostasisIoT firmware. To do so;
   
   * Navigate to https://github.com/pluizer/ApostasisIoT and download and open the ArduinoIoT.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
     
   The firmware will try to connect to a WiFi access point. We must supply it with the name and password:
   
   * Change the line "(wifi-connect \"SSID\" \"PASSWORD\")"; with your correct SSID and PASSWORD of an available Wi-Fi access-point.

   * Compile and upload the project [[images/03.png]]

   At this point the board is ready to connect to the @postasis platform.
